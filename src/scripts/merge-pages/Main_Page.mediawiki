For some reason no Main Page was imported. I'm not sure why.

== The basic method for the scripted merging of the wikis is ==

# Get a list of all the pages across all wikis
## If the same page name exists on multiple wikis, and all wikis have the same content, just import any one of them
## If the same page name exists, but it has different content on different wikis, then create a [[Template:Disambig|Disambiguation Page]] that points to each page. Each page will be named like <nowiki>[[Original page name (BME)]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[Original page name (SPARTAN)]]</nowiki>
# Get all file uploads from all wikis. If multiple wikis have the same file name, randomly pick which one wins (easiest solution for now...there aren't many of these).

== Improvements required for the script ==

# The "MediaWiki" namespace should not be disambiguated. This is also true for the File namespace, I think.
# Figure out how to handle redirects and disambiguations
# Import watchlists, Wiretap, and WatchAnalytics data
# Force creation of
## Template:Disambig
## Main Page

== What we need to do ==

# Standardize templates, properties, forms, categories, and MediaWiki namespace pages.
# Standardize ApprovedRevs stuff

== Example pages ==

* [[SSRMS]] is a disambiguation for EVA and ROBO. However, the content page on EVA is ''Space Station Remote Manipulator System'' and on ROBO it's ''SSRMS''. This creates an odd disambiguation situation.
